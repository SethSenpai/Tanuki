# Tanuki 40% keyboard
### [Firmware files](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/tanuki)

#### Why are these files here?
The firmware files are also hosted over at [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/tanuki) and should be used to compile the firmware in a way that you like. These files are posted here to consolidate the files in one place and allow people to compile using older versions of QMK.

#### What do I do with this?
If this is your first time compiling keyboard firmware you might want to check out the [QMK guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/) or if you made no changes just [flash the .hex file to your pro micro](https://docs.qmk.fm/flashing-firmware).

#### Some notes on this firmware
This firmware release is for the PCB version only.

40% keyboard designed by Seth-Senpai. This repo is meant for the pcb version of the Tanuki. If you made any modifications to the board please make sure that the firmware reflects these changes.

If you decide to handwire a Tanuki just make sure to change the files correctly. If you're lost you can check out the [QMK hand wiring guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/for-makers-and-modders/hand-wiring-guide). The matrix is displayed below.
