#### What is the Tanuki?
The Tanuki is a 40% keyboard that uses a split spacebar design to comfortably switch between layers. The design goal for the Tanuki was to make a staggered 40% keyboard out of materials I had lying around in my workshop.
This is also where it gets its name. A Tanuki or [Japanese raccoon dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_raccoon_dog) is also known as a trash panda on the internet, which I felt was a fitting name for something build out of leftover materials.

#### Why open source?
The reason I am not doing a group buy or anything else of the sort is because I want people to experiment. To try different things with a keyboard that is not going to ruin your bank account if you get it wrong the first time.
I feel that running a group buy or outright producing this keyboard will take away the experimental nature of the project. I want people to take what I designed and mold it into something that is theirs. To use this more as a platform of departure rather than a guide to follow. Ok, I will stop rambling about design philosophy now.

You are of course more than welcome to run your own group buy!

#### Features
+ A staggered design.
+ Extremely small bezel.
+ Interactive RGB underglow that shows what layer you're on.
+ Buttons to turn off or reconfigure your underglow.
+ The ability to modify and adapt the keyboard to your wildest dreams! (and perhaps learn new skills doing so!)

#### Where is %this_key% on the keyboard?
The Tanuki has 3 layers, if the key you want is not on any of these layers you will have to dive into the firmware and put it somewhere you like!

**Base layer:**

**Game layer: (sort of a bad name I know more like arrow layer ah well)**

#### I'm sold, where do I go from here?
Visit build tips to get an idea of how to construct a Tanuki. Otherwise start by making a case by going to the `Case` folder. From there you can decide to handwire your Tanuki or have a pcb made. After that comes assembly and firmware!
